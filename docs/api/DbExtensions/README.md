![Public class] | [ChangeConflictException][2]       | An exception that is thrown when a concurrency violation is encountered while saving to the database. A concurrency violation occurs when an unexpected number of rows are affected during save. This is usually because the data in the database has been modified since it was loaded into memory. 
![Public class] | [Database][1]                      | Provides simple data access using [SqlSet][3], [SqlBuilder][4] and [SqlTable&lt;TEntity>][5].
